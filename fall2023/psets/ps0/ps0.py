# Problem 1a
#


# Input: BTvertex v, the root of a BinaryTree of size n
# Output: Up to you
# Side effect: sets the size of each vertex n in the
# ... tree rooted at vertex v to the size of that subtree
# Runtime: O(n)

    # Base case: when node doesn't exist, don't increment size

# Problem 1c
#


# Input: BTvertex r, the root of a size-augmented BinaryTree T
# ... of size n and height h
# Output: A BTvertex that, if removed from the tree, would result
# ... in disjoint trees that all have at most n/2 vertices
# Runtime: O(h)
